Translate Quform forms into multiple languages using WPML.

== Description ==

With this add-on, a form can be translated into multiple languages using WPML. Gone are the days of having duplicate forms for each language!

### Features

Translate unlimited forms into other languages through WPML.

**Deep integration**

All user-facing strings are fully translatable, including all form settings, fields settings and validation error messages. Emails sent to users can also be translated, along with the confirmation (success) message shown after the form is submitted.

**Advanced WPML compatibility**

Compatible with both the String Translation workflow, and the Advanced Translation Editor.

**Datepicker/timepicker support**

Automatically converts the locale of the datepickers and timepickers into the current WPML language. The dates and times will be automatically formatted according to regional standards.
